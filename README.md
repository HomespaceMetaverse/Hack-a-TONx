# Epine SDK by Homespace for TON-Enabled Applications with TonConnect Authentication
## Overview
The Epine SDK by Homespace is an open-source set of powerful tools for developers to create TON blockchain-enabled applications with TonConnect authentication methods. With Epine SDK, developers can connect Ton wallets via TonConnect, verify wallets, and retrieve balances. The SDK's components include an Unreal Engine Plugin, a C++ Library, and a Server.

## Unreal Engine Plugin

The Unreal Engine Plugin is a wrapper around the C++ library and allows developers to connect Ton wallets to their Unreal Engine applications. It simplifies the integration process and enables developers to focus on their business logic.

## C++ Library

The C++ Library connects to the server via Socket.io and HTTP. It provides developers with an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the TON blockchain and Ton wallets using TonConnect authentication.

## Server

The Server is a backend that implements the logic for TON blockchain and wallet interactions with TonConnect authentication. It enables developers to interact with TON blockchains in a hassle-free manner and focuses on their business logic instead of complex blockchain connections.

The Epine SDK is constantly evolving, and we are always working on adding new functionalities to it. With this SDK, we aim to make TON blockchain-enabled application development simpler, faster, and more efficient.
