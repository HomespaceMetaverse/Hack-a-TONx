# Epine SDK by Homespace for TON-Enabled Applications with TonConnect Authentication
## Overview

We are creating a network of 3D cinematic spaces to be used as a new generation of websites as well as a service for closed virtual reality meetings. We use a streaming system to use the network, and develop a decentralized browser with web3 tools, an asset store, and a constructor (modules, levels, nft).  

For the purpose of the hackathon as a web3 project we created an opensource SDK module - Epine SDK by Homespace. 

The Epine SDK by Homespace is an open-source set of powerful tools for developers to create TON blockchain-enabled applications with TonConnect authentication methods. With Epine SDK, developers can connect Ton wallets via TonConnect, verify wallets, and retrieve balances. The SDK's components include an Unreal Engine Plugin, a C++ Library, and a Server.

## Unreal Engine Plugin

The Unreal Engine Plugin is a wrapper around the C++ library and allows developers to connect Ton wallets to their Unreal Engine applications. It simplifies the integration process and enables developers to focus on their business logic.

## C++ Library

The C++ Library connects to the server via Socket.io and HTTP. It provides developers with an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the TON blockchain and Ton wallets using TonConnect authentication.

## Server

The Server is a backend that implements the logic for TON blockchain and wallet interactions with TonConnect authentication. It enables developers to interact with TON blockchains in a hassle-free manner and focuses on their business logic instead of complex blockchain connections.

The Epine SDK is constantly evolving, and we are always working on adding new functionalities to it. With this SDK, we aim to make TON blockchain-enabled application development simpler, faster, and more efficient.

## What was built during the hackathon?
During the hackathon, we extended our existing SDK solution to support the TON blockchain. We added Ton Connect authentication method, which enables developers to authenticate users using Ton Connect wallets. We also added support for retrieving balances of TON wallets, which provides developers with an easy way to retrieve and display wallet balances in their applications. With these new features, our SDK solution is now even more powerful and versatile, allowing developers to build TON blockchain-enabled applications with ease.
